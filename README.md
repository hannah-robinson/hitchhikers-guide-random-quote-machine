# Hitchhiker's Guide Random Quote Machine

![Screenshot of app](https://github.com/hannah-robinson/hitchhikers-guide-random-quote-machine/blob/main/public/hgttu.jpg)

This React app shows random quotes from (and about) Douglas Adams's "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".

I built this app as an assessed project for freeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries certification. The project was designed to meet the requirements of freeCodeCamp's acceptance criteria. The User Stories can be seen here: [Build a Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)

I chose Hitchhiker's Guide quotes because Douglas Adams is one of my favourite authors. My inspiration for the design came from Douglas Adams's stories.
